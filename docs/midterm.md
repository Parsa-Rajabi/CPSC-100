- Identify the sub-skills that comprise CT
- Apply CT sub-skills to design and execute a structured solution
- Explain/define the concept of Algorithms
  - Describe its relevance to CT and where it originated from
- Define the concepts of decomposition, abstraction and synthesis in relation to an algorithm

### Week 2
- Explain the concept of Generative Artificial Intelligence
  - Describe the relevance of Generative AI in CPSC 100
- Identify and list various GenAI tools to date
- Identify opportunities to use and not use GenAI
- Explain the concept of Intelligent Agents + Chatbots
  - Describe the relevance of Turning Tests to CT
- Explain the concept of Natural Language Processing 
  - Describe the relevance of NLP to CT
- Identify and list the steps associated with traditional NLP
- Explain the dilemma of the Trolly Problem 
  - Describe the relevance of the problem to AI Ethics
- Identify and explain the traditional steps of Natural Language Processing 
- Apply a traditional NLP algorithm to a given input

### Week 3
- Distinguish the difference between hardware, applications, and the operating system.
- Differentiate between the different forms of computer memory.
- Describe Moore‚Äôs law and explain its impact on computing.
- Discuss the implications of consumerist approach to hardware development on developing nations
- Describe the classification steps.
- Explain the concept of a rooted tree and decision tree.
- Describe what the general decisions are in building a decision tree. 
  - Build a decision tree using entropy.
- Describe what considerations are important in building a decision tree.

### Week 4
- Identify the differences between sequential and "breaking bad" algorithms
- Discuss the difference between high level, assembly & machine code.
- Identify and describe the components of an algorithm 
  - (i.e., sequencing, selection, and iteration)
- Use snap blocks to represent algorithms
- Be able to trace through code using sequences of instructions, variables, loops, and conditional statements in short programs
  - Read carefully: it says be able to trace code, not write code.
- Describe in English what a block of Snap! code does

### Week 5
- Define boolean expressions and their role in Snap! Programming
- Apply boolean operations to control flow in programming 
- Describe the concept of loops and iteration in programming 
  - Differentiate between finite loops (repeat N times) and condition-based loops (repeat until) 
- Use logical reasoning to determine the output of given code 
  - Apply CT to trace and evaluate code snippets
- Identify and understand the differences between different types of loops (e.g. repeat, repeat until, for)
- Trace through code using sequences of instructions, variables, loops, and conditional statements in short programs
- Describe in English what a block of Snap! code does. 
- Evaluate if a given snap code block correctly implements an algorithm.
