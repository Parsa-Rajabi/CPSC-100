	                    Would a city with a population of 78,531 and a crime rate of 40&#37; (per year) have more or less crimes than a city with a population of 456,001 and a crime rate of 10&#37; (per year)?

	                    	 <p>The correct answer is B. This is an example of deceptive statistics. When quickly looking at the data, it would appear that the city with the lower crime rate (8&#37;) is the safest to live in. However, when calculating the number of individual crimes committed per year, you will see that the number of crimes in the more populated city (31 412) is less than the number of crimes in the less populated city (45 600).</p>

	                    Given 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 5, 2, 8, 1, 25, 0, 2, 3, 10), how would you calculate the mean, median, and mode?

	                  	<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#module4-q2">Answer</button>

	                    <div id="module4-q2" class="collapse">
	                    	<p>To calculate the mean (i.e., the average), add up all the numbers and then divide the sum by however many numbers there are. In this situation, we would add up all 10 numbers and then divide the resulting sum by 10.</p>

	                    	<p>To calculate the median, arrange the numbers in ascending order and then find the middle two numbers (the fifth and sixth number). Average these two numbers and the result will be the median. In the case where you have an odd number of numbers (e.g., you have 9 numbers), you would arrange all nine numbers in ascending order and then choose the fifth number as the median.</p>

	                    	<p>To calculate the mode, find the number that occurs the most times in the set of numbers you are looking at. In our above example, the number that occurs the most is 2 (it occurs twice). Therefore, the mode of the above set of 10 numbers is 2.</p>
