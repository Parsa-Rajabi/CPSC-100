	                    Google often keeps track of your device location. What kinds of advantages and disadvantages would there be to this kind of tracking?

	                    <br />

	                    <button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#data-mining-q1">Answer</button>

	                    	<p>Note that answers may vary.</p>

	                    	<p>Advantages:</p>
	                    	<ul>
	                    		<li>It can allow the police to track the previous whereabouts of a missing person or person of interest when investigating crimes.</li>
	                    		<li>Services like Google Maps will be more accurate when it comes to predicting traffic or reporting on current conditions.</li>
	                    		<li>City planning services can use this data to see where buildings/services should be placed for maximum convenience.</li>
	                    	</ul>

	                    	<p>Disadvantages:</p>
	                    	<ul>
	                    		<li>Lack of privacy. By constantly sending your location data, you are effectively allowing your movements to be tracked continuously.</li>
	                    		<li>You have no control over your own data. If your data is sold, you may receive much more targeted ads. Your data may be used against you in a court of law or in other situations.</li>

	                    How does data mining benefit companies like Target?

	                    	<li>With the data they have, they are able to gather which products give them the most revenue and how they can promote them.</li>
	                    	<li>It allows them to study the customer and analyse their purchase patterns.</li>
	                    	<li>They are able to build a relationship with the customer through loyalty cards and this helps promote their brand as something more relateable rather than just a place of purchase.</li>
	                    	<li>All of the above</li>

	                    Which of the following are all types of data mining?

	                    	<p>D.</p>

	                    	<p>Association is when you determine the cause and effect of the resulting data, (i.e. people who bought ____ also bought _____). Clustering creates groups of similar things. Anomaly detection identifies what stands out in the data. Support and itemization are not types of data mining.</p>
