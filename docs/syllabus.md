## Course Description

> Meaning and impact of computational thinking. Solving problems using computational thinking, testing, debugging. How computers work. No prior computing experience required. Not for students with existing credit for or exemption from CPSC 107, CPSC 110 or APSC 160. [3-1-0]
[UBC Academic Calender - CPSC 100](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/nest/imager/courses.php#hct)

How have computers impacted the world around you, and how do they do it? CPSC 100 (Computational Thinking) covers related topics, including the way that computers have changed animated movies, what businesses can do with your personal information such as your phone number, how the Internet works, and whether artificial intelligence will destroy the earth.
 
CPSC 100 is NOT a programming course, though there will be a small amount of programming in a visual language so that you can understand a bit of what makes computers tick.
 
CPSC 100 is targeted for first-year students, but is open to all UBC students. You cannot get credit for CPSC 100 if you have credit for CPSC 110.

## Pre-requisites (unofficial)

A strong attention to detail, a willingness to learn new problem-solving techniques, and a desire to work collaboratively with others. No prior computing experience is required.

## Learning Goals
At the highest level, this course has three goals. On completing this course, you will be able to:

- **[Computational Thinking Building Blocks]** Use a computer to solve problems, which breaks down into 4 smaller goals:
  - Use abstraction and decomposition to clarify and simplify the critical pieces of a problem;
  - Choose appropriate models and representations to aid in solving the problem;
  - Recognize potential shortcomings in a model or solution; and
  - Explain at a high level how the computer works;
- **[Computational Thinking Application]** Explain specific algorithms that computers use to create applications of computational thinking (e.g., data mining), and
- **[Computational Thinking Impact]** Provide and explain examples of how computers impact your life and what this means for you, both in terms of how the computer can add to your life and in things that you have to be careful of, such as privacy and security.

|     Final Exam     |    30%     |

Note: the course evaluation is subject to change until Friday, January 10, 2025. After this date, the evaluation will be considered final. Any changes will be communicated to the class during the first week of classes.

**Do not schedule travel or other commitments during the final exam period. Final exam dates are set by the university and are not flexible.**

### iClickers

Your lowest 3 iClicker scores will be automatically dropped — so you can miss up to 3 lectures (e.g. 1 full week) without penalty, and you don’t need to inform us when you miss class. These drops are not intended to be “free-passes” to skip lectures: please reserve them for unexpected emergencies / sickness / … since missing out on content will only disrupt your learning. If there are extenuating circumstances which cause you to miss more than 3 lectures (like prolonged sickness, family emergencies, etc.) then you should contact the teaching team.

### Labs

We expect you to attend your registered lab section on time each week. Many of the labs are dependent on group work, and showing up late will negatively impact other students. If you cannot attend a lab due to illness or other severe circumstances, contact the instructor and provide valid medical or other supporting documentation. 

### Post-class Quizzes

Following each module, there will be a quiz to help ensure you have followed the basic material presented and assess your overall understanding of module content. They serve as a pre-assessment of exam content to help you better prepare.  The quizzes are timed and can only be completed once.  There will be several post-module quizzes throughout the term.

### Exams

If you miss an exam, please contact the instructor as soon as possible. You must contact [UBC Science](https://science.ubc.ca/students/advising) within 48 hours of your missed final exam to apply for a deferred exam. Further information about deferred exams can be found in [UBC Science's Exam FAQ](https://science.ubc.ca/students/advising/exams).

### Project

The project is a group assignment that will be completed throughout the term. The project will be graded based on the quality of the final deliverable, the group's ability to work together, and the individual contributions of each group member. Project details will be provided throughout the first few weeks of the course.

### Passing Criteria

If only we could give you all an A+ just for participating. Fortunately or unfortunately, we can't. UBC requires that students are assessed on the learning outcomes of the course. To pass this course, you must:

- obtain at least a 50% overall grade
- and, in addition, achieve a passing grade (>50%) on the final exam
- and, in addition, achieve a passing grade (>50%) on the course project

Students who fail to meet these requirements will have a final grade of 45% or less.

### Grade Solicitation Policy

Requests for grade adjustments (especially final course grade) based on non-academic reasons are not appropriate and are considered unprofessional. Examples include, but are not limited to, statements such as "I need this grade," "I deserve a higher grade" or any similar personal circumstances.

Students are expected to meet the academic requirements of the course as outlined in this syllabus. Soliciting grade changes undermines the integrity of the evaluation process and may result in a negative impact on your final grade.

If you have concerns about your performance, you are encouraged to seek feedback early and make use of available resources, such as office hours and course support services, to address any challenges proactively.

## Learning Resources

Students in CPSC 100 have diverse backgrounds and learning needs. Various resources are available to help you explore topics of interest in depth. Many students find that just attending lectures and labs is not enough, and you are strongly advised to use the available resources. Note that you should not take needing to seek extra ways to practice what you've learned as a sign that you're "not good at" the material; it's simply that you need more practice. The people in the class who you see who seem to be having no trouble at all have almost certainly had more practice than you (or they're having trouble and don't show it - or both!). Don't freak out. Ask questions and use the help resources: that's what they're for.

TAs and your instructor have office hours. If you require an appointment, contact us with at least a few days notice. TAs are also available during scheduled lab times. (Note that the TAs must prioritize helping students with the scheduled lab assignment.)

Your classmates are an excellent resource for discussion and peer support. In addition to opportunities to chat before and after class, the discussion board is also available.

> [!TIP]
> A note about e-mail support: Many course-related questions require two-way discussion, so e-mail is sometimes not the most efficient way to get help. Office hours and the discussion board should be your first resort for rapid assistance. Please limit e-mail to requests of a personal nature—you'll get faster responses on the discussion board!

## General Advice

- If you don't understand something covered in class, ask about it right away. The only silly question is the one that isn't asked. This class is about exploring your interest in computer science, so don't be shy.
- If you get a mark you do not understand, find out why immediately. Don't wait weeks before asking!
- The lectures and labs are just the beginning – you are responsible for directing your exploration of the topics in sufficient depth both to satisfy your curiosity and to be prepared for exams that will require you to extend, not just repeat, what you have learned in class. Curious about something? Did you try Google or Wikipedia? The teaching team can introduce you to resources and people – ask!
- Resist the temptation to engage in non-course-related activities, such as Facebook, e-mail, texting, etc, during class and lab time. If you remain focused during class time, not only will you earn more participation marks, but you will also use your own time more efficiently by not having to go back and learn the material you missed while distracted.

## Importance of Group Work and Participation Policy

Group work is a vital component of this course, reflecting the collaborative nature of real-world projects. Working effectively in a team is essential for your professional development. It’s important to approach group tasks with respect for each other’s ideas and perspectives, and to ensure that everyone contributes equitably.

Your team's performance in the course project plays a large part in your individual mark. This grade is calculated based on peer evaluations received from your team members, as well as the quality of your contributions to the project. Completing detailed and thoughtful peer evaluations also contributes to your grade.

To maintain fairness and academic integrity, all group members are expected to contribute equally to the project. Here’s how we handle group participation:

1.	**Peer Resolution**: When non-participation issues arise, the first step is for group members to address and attempt to resolve them internally based on the group's agreed-upon terms in the group contract. This includes documenting these efforts—such as meeting notes, emails, or messages on platforms like Slack or Discord—in case further action is required.
2.	**Reporting Non-Participation**: If internal resolution efforts do not succeed, the concerned student(s) should schedule a meeting with their TA. However, it’s important to note that without sufficient evidence of attempts at peer resolution, the TA will not proceed with scheduling the meeting. During the meeting, if scheduled, students should present the documented evidence and discuss possible next steps with the TA.
3.	**TA Intervention**: Following the consultation, the TA may involve other teaching team members to ensure that the workload is fairly distributed and completed by all group members. If additional actions are needed, the teaching team will directly engage with the specific group or individual members to determine the best course of action.

Non-contribution or “free riding” is not acceptable in this course. Every student is expected to contribute meaningfully to group projects. **Repeated failure to participate will result in penalties.** 

## Academic Expectations

In addition to all university rules, regulations, and academic guidelines, the following policies will hold in CPSC 100:

- Attendance and **prompt arrival** is expected at all classes and labs. In addition, there will be participation marks for in-class and lab activities.
- There will be no makeup for the midterm. Students who miss the midterm will receive a grade of zero, unless they have a valid reason for missing the exam and have contacted the instructor in advance with valid supporting documentation.

## Course Textbook/Material

We will read articles, view instructional videos, and read chapters from the following books – all freely available online.

- **[B2B]** Abelson, Hal, Ken Ledeen, and Harry Lewis. 2008. Blown to Bits: Your Life, Liberty, and Happiness After the Digital Explosion. 1st edition. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Addison-Wesley Professional. [Available for free](http://www.bitsbook.com/excerpts/)

## UBC and Course Policies
---

### Academic Integrity

Academic honesty is essential to the continued functioning of the University of British Columbia as an institution of higher learning and research. All UBC students are expected to behave as honest and responsible members of an academic community. Breach of those expectations or failure to follow the appropriate policies, principles, rules, and guidelines of the University with respect to academic honesty may result in disciplinary action.”  

Students are expected to be familiar with and adhere to the [UBC Academic Integrity guidelines](https://learningcommons.ubc.ca/academic-support/academic-integrity-citations/).

A more detailed description of academic integrity, including the University’s policies and procedures, can be found [here](https://academicintegrity.ubc.ca/).

*Failure to comply with any of these responsibilities, either knowingly or through negligence, will also be considered an act of plagiarism and subject to the same penalties.*

### Course Waitlist

- Course waitlists are being handled centrally by the Computer Science department. Go [here](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/undergrad/courses/waitlists) for more information. Students who attend labs will be given waitlist priority.
- If you do not plan to take the course, please remove yourself from the lecture or waitlist, so others may get in.
- Emails to the instructor/TAs about waitlist position will not be answered.

### Late Deliverables 

All course items (e.g. labs, projects, etc.) have a specific due date and time. Your work is late if it is not turned in by the deadline. Labs can be submitted up to 24 hours after the due date with a 25% penalty (unless explicitly stated otherwise). After 24 hours, the submission will not be accepted and a score of zero will be assigned. 

Exams (including post-class quizzes, midterm and final) and course project have a fixed deadline and cannot be submitted late. 

Make-up assessments (including clickers, labs, post-class quizzes, project, exams) will not be given. Sometimes life gets in the way of schedules. Sickness or other unplanned or extraordinary events happen and will be dealt with individually. It is your responsibility to ensure your situation is known to the instructor as soon as reasonably possible. You are accountable for being heard, which means you need to ensure that the instructor heard you.
 
While "life happens," poor planning by you does not count. And definitely do not wait to discuss gray areas. For example, an interview opportunity arises (good!): you should not wait until the day before the lab is due to let us know that you could not complete the lab because you had to prepare for the interview. That would be considered poor planning. Good planning would be to alert the TA or Instructor that you got the interview and, while you hope to finish the lab, there is a concern. Then when you don’t finish on time, it’s clear that you planned your time and that will be taken into consideration. These "good planning" situations will be considered individually as per the instructor's discretion.

In all cases, exceptional situations are considered on an individual basis, subject to the approval of the instructor and supported by legitimate and verified documentation. Refer to accommodations and concessions section below for more details.

### Remarking Policy

As a teaching team, we strive to provide fair and accurate assessments of your work while also providing as much feedback. We encourage you to review the feedback and spend your time/energy where it serves you the most which will be learning from past mistakes and self-improvement. While you reserve your right to ask for a re-grade, we find debating grades an incredible drain on course staff time and energy and prevents us from serving students well and focusing on most important aspects of the course. Regrade requests are not an avenue for you to argue or debate about the grading scheme. Regrade requests are meant as a way for you to let us know about situations where the grading scheme may not have been correctly applied to your work.

If you feel a course item has been incorrectly assessed you may request that the item be remarked. However, before making a remarking request, please complete the following steps:

1. Review the marking rubric and ensure you understand the marking scheme.
2. Review the marking comments and ensure you understand the feedback.
3. Schedule a meeting with the TA to discuss the feedback and marking.
4. If you still feel the marking is incorrect, you may request a re-marking.

#### Request a Remarking

Requests must include a written letter for the re-marking and be submitted to the course TA/instructor within 5 business days from receiving the mark or a deadline specified by the TA/instructor, whichever comes first. The request must be signed and submitted via email. 

Course grades are considered final on a rolling basis (e.g. as we progress through the semester). After the regrading request deadline (e.g., 5 business days or deadline set by TA/instructor), grades will be considered final and no further requests will be accepted. Students are encouraged to review their grades and ask questions within the specified time frame. Inquiries after the deadline will not be considered.

The re-marking request will be reviewed by the teaching team and if accepted, the item will be re-marked in its entirety by both the course instructor and the marking TA. This may result in a higher, unchanged, or lower mark overall which will be final.
