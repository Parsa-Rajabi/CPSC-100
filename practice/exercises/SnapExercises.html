				Most of the exercises have Snap code associated with them. To run the code, download the XML file. Then <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html" target="_blank">open Snap</a>. Click on the file menu (it looks like a piece of paper), and choose &quot;Import&quot;. Then choose the XML file that you downloaded.

	                    	<p>When evaluating <img src="./SnapExercises_files/q7-explanation-1.png" class="img-responsive singleBlockExplanation"> blocks, we only need one blank out of the two to be true in order for the whole statement to be true.

	                    	<p>Since we know X = 0 (because <img src="./SnapExercises_files/q7-explanation-5.png" class="img-responsive singleBlockExplanation"> set X = 0), we know that <img src="./SnapExercises_files/q7-explanation-4.png" class="img-responsive singleBlockExplanation"> is true and thus, the sprite will say "Hello!".</p>

	                    	<p>The only time an <img src="./SnapExercises_files/q9-explanation-1.png" class="img-responsive singleBlockExplanation"> block will evaluate to true is when both blanks have statements that evaluate to true.

	                    	<p>To evaluate whether or not <img src="./SnapExercises_files/q10-explanation-1.png" class="img-responsive singleBlockExplanation"> is true, we must first look at each statement at each side of the block.

	                    	<hr>

	                    	<h3>Explanation</h3>
	                    	<p>The blocks will always execute from top down. Therefore, the first three blocks (<img src="./SnapExercises_files/q3-explanation-1.png" class="img-responsive singleBlockExplanation">, <img src="./SnapExercises_files/q3-explanation-2.png" class="img-responsive singleBlockExplanation">, and <img src="./SnapExercises_files/q3-explanation-3.png" class="img-responsive singleBlockExplanation">) will execute. At this point, <img src="./SnapExercises_files/q3-explanation-3.png" class="img-responsive singleBlockExplanation"> would cause the sprite to say "Hmm. Do we have enough elves?".</p>

	                    	<p>When we get to the <img src="./SnapExercises_files/q3-explanation-4.png" class="img-responsive explanation"> block, we need to determine whether or not the statement next to the "if" is true. If the statement is true, the blocks wrapped inside the "if" block will execute. If the statement is false, then the blocks wrapped inside the "else" block will execute.</p>

	                    	<p>When evaluating a statement for true/false, we work from the inside out. Looking at <img src="./SnapExercises_files/q3-explanation-5.png" class="img-responsive singleBlockExplanation">, we can slowly start to break it down to get to the block that is at the inside (i.e., the block that is contained within all the other blocks). The process of breaking down <img src="./SnapExercises_files/q3-explanation-5.png" class="img-responsive singleBlockExplanation"> would be the following: <img src="./SnapExercises_files/q3-explanation-5.png" class="img-responsive singleBlockExplanation"> → <img src="./SnapExercises_files/q3-explanation-6.png" class="img-responsive singleBlockExplanation"> → <img src="./SnapExercises_files/q3-explanation-7.png" class="img-responsive singleBlockExplanation">. </p>

	                    	<p><img src="./SnapExercises_files/q3-explanation-7.png" class="img-responsive singleBlockExplanation"> asks us for the <b>remainder</b> when dividing numToys by numElves. In this case, this would be 6 because 5006 divided by 100 would be 50 with a remainder of 6.</p>

	                    	<p>Now, we move onto the next smallest block (<img src="./SnapExercises_files/q3-explanation-6.png" class="img-responsive singleBlockExplanation">). This block asks us whether or not it is true that (numToys mod numElves) is equal to 0. Since we know that is not true, this block is false. </p>

	                    	<p>Having solved this block, let's move onto the next smallest block (<img src="./SnapExercises_files/q3-explanation-5.png" class="img-responsive singleBlockExplanation">). This block asks us to negate the result of whatever is contained in it (i.e., make something true into false and make something false into true). This means that we negate the false result that we obtained from <img src="./SnapExercises_files/q3-explanation-6.png" class="img-responsive singleBlockExplanation"> to get true. Since this statement is true, whatever is inside the "if" in <img src="./SnapExercises_files/q3-explanation-4.png" class="img-responsive explanation"> (i.e., <img src="./SnapExercises_files/q3-explanation-8.png" class="img-responsive singleBlockExplanation">) will execute!</p>

	                    	<h3>Explanation</h3>
	                    	<p>In <img src="./SnapExercises_files/q1-question.png" class="img-responsive singleBlockExplanation">, the repeat loop repeats nine times (y = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). On the nineth repeat (i.e., when y=9), it will stop the condition specified in the repeat until loop has come true. In option A, the repeat loop is set to execute 10 times. In option B, the repeat until loop never runs since we never give y an initial value before running the repeat until loop. In option C, the repeat loop runs 9 times and the code inside the loop is roughly equivalent to the code in our question.</p>

	                    	<h3>Explanation</h3>
	                    	<p>In the question, the Ding sound only plays when the variable randomNumber is equal to 2 or 8. If randomNumber is any other number, the Aw sound plays.</p>

	                    	<p>In option A, the Ding sound would only play when a number is equal to both 8 and 2 at the same time. This is both impossible (a variable cannot have two different values at the same time) and not equivalent to the code in the question.</p>

	                    	<p>In option B, the Ding sound will only play if randomNumber is 2 or 8. Otherwise, the Aw sound will play. However, in the initial code, Aw will play if 8 is selected, so they are not equivalent</p>

	                    	<p>In option C, the Ding sound will play if randomNumber is 2 or 8. However, the Aw sound will always play (since it is not wrapped inside an if block).</p>

	                    	<p>The only difference between option C and D is when the Aw sound is played. In option C, the Aw sound is always played while in option D, the Aw sound is only played if randomNumber is not 2 or 8. Since that matches our question, option D is also equivalent.</p>
