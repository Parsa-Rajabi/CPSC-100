	                   What is the difference between &#34;weak&#34; and &#34;strong&#34; AI?


	                	<ol type="a">
	                		<li>Weak AI simply appears to be intelligent, while strong AI must be able to actually think and understand.</li>
	                		<li>Weak AI fails the Turing Test while strong AI successfully passes.</li>
	                		<li>Weak AI is represented by the Chinese Room analogy, while strong AI is represented by Alan Turing&#39;s work.</li>
	                		<li>Weak AI may forever loop an algorithm to find an answer (&#34;the halting problem&#34;), while strong AI will successfully overcome this.</li>
	                	</ol>

	                    <div id="ai-q2" class="collapse">
	                    	<p>A - Correct. This is the actual definition of weak and strong AI (as shown in the slides). Alan Turing looks into the concept of weak AIs, while John Searle philosophizes about strong AIs.</p>

	                    	<p>B - No AI has yet been universally acknowledged to pass the Turing Test, which is an concept that is only related to the field of weak AIs.</p>

	                    	<p>C - This should be the reverse. Alan Turing focused on how an AI could eventually look to be an intelligent being, while the Chinese Room analogy is related to the concept of strong AI.</p>

	                    	<p>D - While the halting problem is related to AI, it is unrelated to how we categorize weak and strong AIs.</p>

	                    	<p>No. While Tay is similar to Cleverbot and Eliza, it doesn&#39;t create ideas nor does understand what it is saying. It only responds to the user input.</p>

	                    	<p>C. Watson is closer to being a weak AI because it uses machine learning algorithms and advanced statistical techniques to access data and answer questions without attempting to have any real &quot;understanding&quot;.

	                    	<p>D. The Turing Test is a test of a machine&#39;s ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, a human. The Chinese Room Test argues that a program can not give a computer a mind, consciousness or understanding. Therefore, it can not be &#34;smarter&#34; than a human. As a result, the Chinese Room Test argues against the Turing Test.</p>

	                		<li>CleverBot replies to questions with answers that have already been programmed in by the creators (it chooses the best reply out of the given answers); therefore making its answers humanistic.</li>
	                		<li>CleverBot uses past human answers to answer questions in new interactions, which make it seem human because it knows everyday language.</li>
	                		<li>It breaks down the question into keywords and phrases, applies predicates on those keywords, searches information about the keywords, and ranks the results.</li>

	                    	<p>A: False. The Turing Test is unrelated to whether or not something is actually a machine or a human. To pass the Turing Test, a machine has to answer questions in a way that would fool a human into thinking that he/she is conversing with another human.</p>

	                    	<p>B: False. This is what Eliza does. It is easy to see that she is a machine because her answers do not vary much and often draw upon portions of your previous answer.</p>

	                    	<p>C: Correct. Cleverbot replies very similarly to a human (knows slang etc.) because it uses conversations from humans.</p>

	                    	<p>D: False. This is how Watson, the Jeopardy machine, thinks (refer to the videos we watched in class).</p>

	                	<ol type="a">
	                		<li>Had an online knowledge base with all the possible structured questions and answers stored</li>

	                    	<p>A: False. The database was not connected to the Internet directly. As we saw in the video, it would have been too slow to have Watson connected to the Internet to look for an answer.</p>

	                    	<p>B: Correct.</p>

	                    	<p>C: Incorrect. Watson does not analyze speech</p>

	                    	<p>D: Incorrect. Psychophysics (physical stimuli and mental phenomenon) was not used, but a type of Bayesian belief network for probability could have been used.</p>
