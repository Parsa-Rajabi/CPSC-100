                           <p>Protocols specify how the client and server should communicate with each other. For example, when you use the Internet, you may have noticed that some sites you visit use &#34;http&#34; at the beginning of the URL while others use &#34;https&#34;. HTTP stands for hypertext transport protocol and it is a set of standards that dictate how the client and server should communicate in order for the client to fetch files from the server and for the server to obtain input from the client.</p>

                           <p>Domain names allow people to easily identify a website. An example of a domain name is &#34;google.ca&#34;.</p>

                           <p>File &amp; directory is a way to specify where a file lives on the server. For example, &#34;/course/main.php&#34; indicates that a file (main.php) lives in a folder called course.</p>

                           <p>A server is a machine that provides a service for other machines (called clients). For example, a server may store files for other machines to access or it may be responsible for performing computations for other machines.</p>

                            <p>Routers act as the supervisor for the transfer of data from one network to another. Conceptualize a router as a gatekeeper, or doorway, that facilitates the transfer of information. For example, in order for data on your personal computer to reach your ISP (Internet Service Provider), a router must act as the mediator in conducting the transfer of that data. Therefore, wherever two networks intersect, there must be a router acting as the facilitator of the connection between those networks.</p>

                            <p>B is correct. The server stores the file onto the client computer and the client computer will return the cookie to the server with each page request.</p>

                            <p>C is correct. Cookies often store information like how often you visit a page.</p>

                            <p>D is incorrect. The appearance of a website is determined by the files on the server.</p>

                            <p>E is correct. Ad companies can use cookies to track what ads you&#39;ve seen so far in order to tailor future ads to your interests.</p>

                            <p>A is incorrect. The IP packets are sent independently to avoid the delay of transmissions (page 51).</p>

                            <p>B is correct. If the protocol detects slow progress of a packet, it will throw it away to decrease traffic. When the packet is not quickly detected at the destination, the recipient server will request for it to be re-sent. (page 51).</p>

                            <p>C is incorrect. Packets are sent independently and one at a time (page 50).</p>
