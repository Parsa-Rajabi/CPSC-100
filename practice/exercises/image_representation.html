                            Each of R, G, and B is 8 bits so RGB together would be 24 bits. 1 byte is 8 bits so 24 bits is 3 bytes.

                             RGB is based on 256 intensified for each of the red, green and blue. The shades of white and black can be represented in binary and hex.

                            <p>Colours are represented as 24 bits with the first 8 bits representing the amount of red, the next 8 bits representing the amount of green, and the last 8 bits representing the amount of blue. The 0b in front of 000000001111111100000000 indicates that a number is in binary form and does not affect the RGB value. Looking at 000000001111111100000000, we see that the first and last 8 bits are all 0 meaning that there is no red or blue in the colour. The middle 8 bits are all 1&#39;s meaning that there is as much green in the colour as possible.</p>

                            While bitmaps define images as grids of pixels, vectors describe them based on points and how they&#39;re connected. An advantage of this is that vector images don&#39;t pixelate when you zoom in on them.

                            <p>Since &#34;E1&#34; is (relatively) much bigger when compared to &#34;15&#34; and &#34;13&#34;, this is probably a shade of green. I can make this darker by decreasing the numbers to subtract light. To keep it balanced, I'd try to decrease them in the same propotions.</p>

                            <p>Another way of thinking about this is move each colour closer to black. Since we know that black is the absence of light (black results when R, G, and B values are 0), we want each R, G, and B value to move closer to 0 (i.e., decrease).</p>

                            <p>A is true because in the RGB value 0114FF, the value of R = 01, the value of G = 14, and the value of B = FF. The value of B is much larger than the values of R and G and overshadows the other two shades.</p>

                            <p>B is true. It is how vector images work.</p>

                            <p>C is false. A run of identical colours can be compressed into a <b>loseless</b> compression. Lossy compression takes areas with similar colours and compresses it by making it all the same colour.</p>

                            <p>D is true. While black is the absence of all light, white is the presence of all light.</p>

                            <p>E is true. In the RGB value FF01FE, both R and B have high values meaning the resulting colour has a lot of red and blue. Since FF and FE are roughly the similar, we can consider the resulting colour to be a fairly even mix of red and blue which makes purple.</p>
